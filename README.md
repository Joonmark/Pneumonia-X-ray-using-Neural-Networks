# Pneumonia-X-ray-using-Neural-Networks

# Goal
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how machine learning can enhance healthcare operations by automating certain tasks. Through deep learning models, we can provide clinicians with data-driven insights to allow for better decision making by saving time and money diagnosing illnesses. In this scenario, we will be looking into chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Childrenâ€™s Medical Center, Guangzhou. By leveraging neural network models, we can classify chest X-rays as either showing signs of pneumonia or appearing normal to reduce diagnostic errors and expedite treatment. We will fine tune hyperparameters to optimize performance and prevent overfitting. This task will be repeated until the classification accuracy reaches satisfactory (>90%). As a result, we hope that utilizing machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow will allow for more accessable healthcare for those in underserved areas by reducing the time and cost for treatment.
